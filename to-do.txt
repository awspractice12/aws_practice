1>  Send email using SES on build complete - success or failure
    On success, get kubernetes cluster status and include in email
2>  Have a pluggable pipeline
    a> Code source could be AWS, Azure, Github
    b> Docker repo could be AWS, Azure, Dockerhub
    c> Kubernetes could be AWS, Azure, OpenShift
    d> Lambda could be AWS, Azure, etc..
3>  Deomonstrate that code changes are reflected in final deployment
    May be port change, or pod replica count
4>  Manager approval stage
5>  blue-green deployment
6>  for each environment, build from its own branch. is this required?
7>  Parametrized build (Manual trigger)
